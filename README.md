# WikipediaGraphAnalysis
We have scrapped data of wikipedia and build a graph of about 10000 nodes of maths topis. Then we have analysed that graph to get some meaningful insights from the graph as it's diameter, clustering coefficient of nodes, betweeness centrality, closeness centrality. 

We have also build a neural network that will help in predicting the label of each page and categorising them as easy medium and hard or irrelevant according to an aspiring JEE student. We have predicted labels of all 10000 nodes using the data that we have collected.

We have also developed a feature that will help students in learning the topics in a sequential manner. Suppose a student wants to read Algebra, then our model will tell you all the topics that you need to study algebra in a easy to hard fashion
